apiVersion: inference.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: InferencePool
metadata:
  name: capital-agent-pool # Name for your Inference Pool
  # Ensure this namespace matches where your Deployment/Pods are running
  namespace: default # Or <YOUR_APP_NAMESPACE>
spec:
  # This selector MUST match the labels defined in your capital-agent Deployment's pod template
  selector:
    app: capital-agent-server # This label connects the pool to the pods
  # This is the port your container is listening on (defined in the Deployment and Dockerfile)
  targetPorts:
    - number: 8080
  # Note: The 'extensionRef' for an Endpoint Picker is omitted for simplicity.
  # This defaults to round-robin load balancing across the pods in the pool.
